# Form Submission & Calendly Integration Update

## 🎯 Problem Solved

### Issue 1: Missing Required Field
- **Problem**: The Book Consultation form was missing the `industry` field that is required by the API endpoint
- **Impact**: Form submissions were failing with "Missing required fields" error
- **Solution**: Added Industry dropdown field to the Book Consultation form

### Issue 2: Disruptive Calendly Integration
- **Problem**: Calendly booking opened in a new browser window/tab, disrupting the user experience
- **Impact**: Users had to navigate away from the page, losing context
- **Solution**: Created a seamless modal-based Calendly integration
